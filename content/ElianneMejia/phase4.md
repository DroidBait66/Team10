## Individual Contribution 

I took the lead on implementation for the front end pages and API routes associated with the AsylumSeeker and Lawyer personnas, along with all of the country routes. The asylum acceptance probability, seek legal aid, user profile (both for AsylumSeeker and Lawyer personnas), and decision stats were implemeneted entirely by me. All other pages for said personnas were implemented in collaboration with some of my teammates. Additionally, I implemented the log in screen functionality. I was also responsible for generating all of the mock data used in our application.
