## Phase 4

For phase 4 I contributed to fixing the logistic regression model’s assumptions. To do this I fixed the calculations for the residuals and replotted the data, including a log-odds plot. Following this I made a heat map to display the predicted acceptance rate for the asylums and I worked on the UI for the asylum seeker user. I worked on the user profile for the asylum, including displaying the application, family members and lawyers assigned. For the lawyer user I displayed the pro bono applications to ensure the applicants were in a grid setup so it wasn’t as difficult to see/find an application. For the commissioner user I rescaled the acceptance rate per capita chart since the original scales made it difficult to understand. I also redid the table on the aid dashboard to only include countries with 1 or more projects. For the overall app I redid the logo so it no longer had a white background and I rescaled it on the sidebar. I created the about the creators section, changed the fonts and colors throughout the entire app. I also changed the colors of the buttons for each page so they were uniform. Finally I went through every graph/plot and rounded the values and changed the size of the tooltips to make the graphs easy to read.
