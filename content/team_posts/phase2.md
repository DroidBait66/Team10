# Project Updates
As a result of the feedback we received, we made several changes to the refugee, Mohammed, and lawyer, Mark, user personas. 
## <https://droidbait66.github.io/Team10/team_posts/phase1post/#mohammed-is-a-17-year-old-boy-from-syria-he-is-a-practicing-muslim-his-parents-were-recently-killed-due-to-bombings-in-his-area-and-he-is-seeking-asylum-with-his-5-year-old-sister-and-10-year-old-brother> Mohammed
* Three of our user stories utilized the same application feature, so, we condensed these user stories into one. Rather than three separate pages 
for country ranking, asylum acceptance probability, and aslyum application demographic statistics, these will all be shown on one page which illustrates all of these data. 
* We added two new stories which will allow our users to view data regarding religous cliamte and demographics and also information about education systems/ rankings.
